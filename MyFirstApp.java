// Jva has tree standart looping condtructs: while, do-while, and for.
// Statements end in a semicolon;
// Code blocks are defined by a pair of curly braces {}
//Declare an integer variable with a name and type: int x;
// The assignment operator is one equel sign =
// The equel operator uses two equel sign ==
// A while loop runs everything within its block (defined by curly braces) as long as the conditional test is true.
// If the conditional test is false, the while loop code block won't run, and execution will move down to the code immediately after the loop block.
// Put a boolean test inside parentheses: while (x == 4) {}
